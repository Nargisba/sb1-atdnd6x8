# X-ray Implant Detector

This program analyzes X-ray images to detect and measure implants. It identifies implants in the image, calculates their dimensions, and creates an annotated copy of the X-ray with measurements.

## Usage

```bash
python implant_detector.py <path_to_xray_image>
```

## Features

- Detects multiple implants in a single X-ray image
- Measures width, height, and diameter of each implant
- Annotates the original image with measurements
- Saves a copy of the annotated image
- Prints detailed measurements in the terminal

## Important Notes

This is a simplified implementation and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis. For medical use, please:

1. Use proper medical imaging libraries
2. Implement proper calibration
3. Validate results with medical professionals
4. Use appropriate medical imaging standards

## Output

The program will:
1. Print measurements for each detected implant in the terminal
2. Create an annotated copy of the X-ray with visual measurements
3. Save the annotated image with a timestamp

## Limitations

- Uses basic thresholding for detection
- Measurements are in pixels (not calibrated to real-world units)
- May need adjustment of threshold values for different X-ray images
- Limited to basic image processing due to standard library constraints
